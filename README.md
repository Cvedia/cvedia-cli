# Cvedia CLI

The CLI tool executes your export as preconfigured on the Cvedia platform. By passing the Job ID on the commandline that was shown on the website, all your filters and augmentations will be retrieved and applied to the chosen dataset.

It supports saving the export in several formats and more will be added over time. Currently the following frameworks and file formats are supported:

**Caffe**
- CaffeImageData
- HDF5

**TensorFlow**
- TFRecords

**Generic**
- CSV
